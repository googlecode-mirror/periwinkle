Three Factions:
Kravakan Death Warriors (known to humans as the Annihilators)
United Earth Military Force (UEMF)
Independent Finders Union (IFU)

*Possible gameplay concept* Random corporations formed and destroyed based on planetary activity.
Player can create his own independent corporation and destroy others or alliance with them.
TL;DR: Random corporation generation affected by player and npc activity in addition to major factions.

Three major milestones in main story missions, different random story events take place altering

Milestone 1:
1. Earth is destroyed by doomsday missle launching event. Accidental DM launch causes massive retaliation
   attacks between the democratic western earth and the communist east, breaking the cold war and 
   resulting in the planet's complete destruction. No communication from earth commanders causes break
   down in UEMF chain of command and hysterical soldiers leads to complete collapse of UEMF. 
   Remaining soldiers are scattered or joined with other corporations. Player must salvage what he can
   from the UEMF facility and gather left over soldier to join another corp. and/or found his own.
    
2. The Kravakan have been dealt a major blow by a UEMF engineered virus sweeping through their
   ranks and infecting half their warriors. Due to the extremely contagious nature of the virus, the 
   normally bold kravakan are forced into paranoia of their own soldiers in order to prevent further 
   infections. The player is forced to become more careful of who he selects as his squadmates to 
   avoid infection as he searches for a cure. Virus has no symptoms until a certain gestation time, upon
   which infected will show minor common sickness signs occaisionally. Once the full length of the virus
   is reached, the infected kravakan's brain will explode sending diseased material all over the area and
   infecting nearby kravakan. As a side effect, the virus
