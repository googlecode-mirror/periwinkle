Conversation Concept:

Player (P): What do you know about this planet?
Squad (S): Not much. All I've ever heard about this place was that Captian Zerato made his final stand here
P: Captain Who?
S: Zerato. He was supposedly the fiercest pirate in the universe. No one knows if he actually existed though; the only evidence of him was supposed to have burned up when he was shot down to this very planet.
